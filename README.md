<body>
  I am a high school student, currently experiencing the IB Program at Glenforest Secondary School. As a highly ambitious and dedicated individual, I excel in my academic environment, achieving averages above 95%, and embrace a proactive approach to learning. Outside of school, I take the time to immerse myself in my community and tutor students in Math, Science, and English as part of a non-profit organization that aids children of various backgrounds and economic statuses.

I am deeply passionate about Math and the Sciences and hope to pursue a STEM-related career. Recently, I have been interested in machine learning and I am working on a few Python-related projects. Feel free to connect with me and check out my GitHub: https://github.com/anixa-s!
